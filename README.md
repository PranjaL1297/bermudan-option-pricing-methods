# Twice-Exercisable Bermudan Put Option Pricing

This repository presents the pricing of a **twice-exercisable Bermudan put option** using various Monte Carlo techniques under a risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. Developed as part of my MSc Quantitative Finance program at UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School.

## üßÆ Objective

To value a Bermudan put option with early exercise allowed at:
- **T1 = 3/12 (0.25 years)**
- **T2 = 6/12 (0.5 years)**

The following pricing methods are implemented and compared:
- Standard Monte Carlo (MC)
- Conditional Monte Carlo (CMC)
- Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC)
- Binomial Tree (for benchmarking)

## üìå Features

### ‚úÖ Binomial Tree Pricing
- Provides a benchmark price.
- Price: **‚Ç¨10.49**

### ‚úÖ Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation
- Simulates 10,000 paths.
- Uses GBM model to simulate asset price trajectories.
- Price: **‚Ç¨12.53**
- 95% Confidence Interval: [12.32, 12.74]
- Proportional Error: **3.35%**

### ‚úÖ Conditional Monte Carlo (CMC)
- Improves on standard MC by conditioning on T1.
- Price: **‚Ç¨13.40**
- 95% Confidence Interval: [13.29, 13.51]

### ‚úÖ Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC)
- Implements Longstaff-Schwartz regression-based approach.
- Adapts to multiple exercise opportunities.
- Price: **‚Ç¨10.34**
- 95% Confidence Interval: [10.13, 10.55]
- Proportional Error: **2.01%**

## üîç Comparative Insights

- **CMC** yielded the highest price due to more accurate modeling of early exercise decision points.
- **LSMC** demonstrated greater flexibility, useful for multiple exercise dates.
- **Standard MC** is less precise but useful as a baseline.
- **Binomial Tree** remains a strong benchmark for discrete early exercise options.
